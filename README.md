# Courier

You need to design a program for a courier company to calculate the cost
of sending a parcel.

Ask the user to enter the price of the package they would like to purchase.

Ask the user to enter the total distance of the delivery in kms.

Now add on the delivery costs to get the ﬁnal cost of the product:

o There are four categories to factor in when determining a parcel’s
ﬁnal cost, each with two options based on their delivery
preferences. (Use an if-else statement based on the choice they
make.)
    
    ▪ Air R0.36 per km or f reight R0.25 per km
    
    ▪ Full insurance R50.00 or limited insurance R25.00
    
    ▪ Gift R15.00 or no gift R0.00
    
    ▪ Priority R100.00 or standard delivery R20.00

Work out the total cost of the package based on the selection in each
category.
